          Neha Arora is a third-year Film and Television student at Sheridan College with a passion for production design and directing.<br /><br />
          What began as a hobby editing videos turned into a love for filmmaking, and during her time at Sheridan, she found her voice in production designâ€”creating visually striking sets across a range of student films.<br /><br />
          Neha has also explored cinematography, editing, and directing. In 2024, she directed her first short film <em>The Beauty of Letting Go</em> with a group of close collaborators.
